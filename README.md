# Event_Reminder App
The Event Reminder App is an Android Java application that allows users to add and edit reminders with a title, date, time, event category and additional notes.
The code I provided for the app with SQLite database uses the NotificationCompat.Builder class to create a notification and the
NotificationManager class to display the notification to the user.
